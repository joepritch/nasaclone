## NASA Clone
#### _A clone of the front page of the NASA website. 15 February 2019_

#### By _Joe Pritchett_

## Description

This project utilizes various CSS mechanics to create a near replica of the NASA website - visually speaking.

I used flexboxes for the navbar, and a CSS grid for the main content of the body.

All images featured on my site were pulled from the NASA site, though the NASA site updated while I was in the middle of my project, which is why some of the images in my screenshots are different.

I had tried to embed the same twitter feed featured on the original site, but it was causing problems with my CSS grid and I ultimately decided not to do it. However the code for it is still in 'index.html' if you would like to try enabling it.
